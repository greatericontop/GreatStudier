# GreatStudier

A free and open source studying software. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 (or higher), although 3.6 will probably work.
- `Levenshtein` module: Install using `pip install Levenshtein` or the equivalent (`python3 -m pip`, `pip3`, etc.) for your system.

## Usage

Run `main.py` in the root directory of the project.

Default directory for sets is `~/GreatStudier/`. You can change this in the configurations. **NOTE MAKE SURE TO TYPE TO FULL PATH TO THE DIRECTORY OR IT MIGHT BREAK.**

It is suggested to edit the options file though the cli.
